My concerns:

1. I would prefer the API results to be fully integrated, so that they display not as MET data, and then AIC data beneath

2. Related to 1, I need to create default way of displaying results (before user adds queries/sorting themselves) 
and this needs to be paginated so I am not making hundreds/thousands of API calls (it looks like I need to make a call per object/artwork)


1. Some fields such as artist gender (available on MET) are not available on both API datasets. But it would be cool to have something like this to query
I'm wondering how realistic it would be to then add some other logic, that makes another http request (e.g. API or web scrape) to find this information, for example by using name
I'm not hung up on the example, but more interested in the idea of making a second request to transform my data before serving it

2. If I was to make a backend/API and my own database for user account information/authentiation, would it be advisable to add all this API fetching logic into my own API?
Or is it still better to fetch directly in the frontend?
